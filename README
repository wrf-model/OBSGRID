WRF Objective Analysis Program 

The WRF Objective analysis (OA) program is a program
that blends observations (in the form of ASCII format) and background
(first guess) fields from WPS/metgrid. It provides a simple way to
add observations to the incoming data from another model. 

Historically, this program began in the mid 90s as the objective
analysis program little_r (Dave Gill) and was later modified for
use by the WRF system (Cindy Bruyere).

For questions and help to run the program, please see Chapter 7 of the WRF Users' Guide:

For information on observation nudging and how OBSGRID can be used to prepare
observations for use in observation nudging also see the Observation Nudging Users' Guide:
